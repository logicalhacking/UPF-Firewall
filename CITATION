	abstract = {Firewalls are an important means to secure
	            critical ICT infrastructures. As configurable
	            off-the-shelf prod\-ucts, the effectiveness of a
	            firewall crucially depends on both the correctness
	            of the implementation itself as well as the
	            correct configuration. While testing the
	            implementation can be done once by the
	            manufacturer, the configuration needs to be tested
	            for each application individually. This is
	            particularly challenging as the configuration,
	            implementing a firewall policy, is inherently
	            complex, hard to understand, administrated by
	            different stakeholders and thus difficult to
	            validate. This paper presents a formal model of
	            both stateless and stateful firewalls (packet
	            filters), including NAT, to which a
	            specification-based conformance test case
	            gen\-eration approach is applied. Furthermore, a
	            verified optimisation technique for this approach
	            is presented: starting from a formal model for
	            stateless firewalls, a collection of
	            semantics-preserving policy transformation rules
	            and an algorithm that optimizes the specification
	            with respect of the number of test cases required
	            for path coverage of the model are derived. We
	            extend an existing approach that integrates
	            verification and testing, that is, tests and
	            proofs to support conformance testing of network
	            policies. The presented approach is supported by a
	            test framework that allows to test actual
	            firewalls using the test cases generated on the
	            basis of the formal model. Finally, a report on
	            several larger case studies is presented.},
